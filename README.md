# \<codit\ Quiz>
(Developer: Valentino Braga)


\<codit\> Your JavaScript Quiz is a simple quiz designed for newbies in software development. The game has 10 questions for each new entry and by the end, you can see how many questions you got right. This project's goal is to help new developers not only to test their knowledge but also to learn more about JS in a fun and interactive way.

# Design

The website's quiz is designed in four continuous interfaces to enable the user to have a smooth and intuitive experience. The priorities of the \<codit\> are to give an organized and effortless design throughout the quiz, the ability to test the user's expertise and the possibility of continuously learn through random and different questions each time.

The concept behind this project is a minimalist, futuristic and tech kind of vibe. Which is reflected in the logo font that resembles coding-fonts design, in the straightforward colour palette (black, white and JS yellow) and consistent design through the interfaces, buttons and the error page, aiming a positive user experience.

## Wireframes

The initial concept of the design can be seen here and they were made through the Balsamiq wireframing software.

## Typography

Overpass Mono and Press Start 2P fonts were chosen from Google Fonts. Fonts were selected to represent clear, minimalist and "coding" feel they inspire in the user.

## Colour Palette

The colour chosen were: white (#ffffff), JS yellow (#F9DD3C) and github grey-black (#1E1E1E). The colours were tested on Webaim using their contrast checker and the ratio was higher than 12.25:1 meaning that they are a great fit.

## Structure 

To keep the user interface as easy and smooth as possible I choose 4 game areas continously played and the 404 Error Page. 

- Start Area: The first interface is the start area where the user is greeted and asked about their name.
- Rules Area: The second interface showcase the quiz rules and call the user by their name.
- Quiz Area: The third interface is where the questions and answers are displayed. 
- Score Area: The fourth interface gives users their score and the possibility to restart the quiz.
- Error 404 Page: The Error page is created for broken links with a button to return to the game.
